## Hi there! I'm Panashe 🐼

**`Software Engineer`**
> Just a humble code artisan, crafting digital magic one line at a time.

### Who Am I? 😄

- 🎉 A software engineer by profession (another coder trying not break the internet), but a full-time bug fixer by reality.
- 💻 My IDE is my playground, where bugs are just misunderstood features, even though it sometimes feels like a haunted house.🧟‍♂️
- ☕ Fueled by coffee, driven by curiosity, and occasionally distracted by dog videos. 🐶
- 🧠 Fun fact: I still Google "how to center a div" more often than I'd like to admit.

### What I Do 🚀

- **Frontend Fiddler**: Attempting to make the web look good, one pixel at a time. ☕➡️🎨
- **Backend Builder**: Crafting the logic that runs behind the scenes, with just a sprinkle of magic dust. ✨
- **Mobile Maker**: Building apps that (hopefully) don’t crash your phone. 📱
- **DevOps Dabbler**: Automating things to avoid doing them myself (because who likes manual work, right?). 🤖

### A Few Projects I’m Proud Of 🛠️

- **<a href="https://oono.events" target="_blank">🚀 Oono.events</a>**: An event platform that makes organizing and attending events as easy as liking a meme. Offline ticketing, online ticketing, and everything in between—because who doesn’t love options?
- **<a href="https://oono.cloud" target="_blank">📦 Oono.cloud</a>**: A cloud storage platform designed to make your digital workflow as smooth as possible. Real-time updates, secure access, and peace of mind—what more could you ask for?
- **<a href="https://oono.chat" target="_blank">💬 Oono.chat</a>**: A chat application that’s more secure than your grandma’s cookie jar. With end-to-end encryption and real-time updates, it’s the communication tool you didn’t know you needed.
- **<a href="https://url.shortie.one" target="_blank">⛓️‍💥 URL Shortie</a>**: A URL shortener that makes long links short and sweet. Perfect for anyone who’s tired of copy-pasting monster URLs across the internet.
- **<a href="https://kidsalert.co.zw" target="_blank">👦🏽 KidsAlert</a>**: A platform dedicated to child safety and awareness. Because keeping kids safe should be everyone’s priority, and technology can help make it happen.

### What I'm Up To These Days 💼

- 💡 Figuring out how to automate everything so I can spend more time learning (or napping, let’s be honest).
- 📚 Trying to master [Cool Tech Stack] while keeping my sanity intact.
- 🌍 Dreaming up projects that could help make the world a little better—one line of code at a time.
